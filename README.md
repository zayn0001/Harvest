This was a paid React Native commission. It is a brief concept of a food donation app that you would use to donate sufficiently large quantities of leftovers by having them picked up by service workers who will then distribute them to shelters. Apart from homes, this also aims to target events, bakeries. A basic interface was all that was needed so this has been put on hold.
